The HTML <canvas> element is used to draw graphics on a web page.

The HTML <canvas> element is only a container for graphics. You must use a script to actually draw the graphics.

Canvas has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and adding images.

Canvas is supported by all major browsers.
